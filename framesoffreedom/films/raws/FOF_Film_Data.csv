2023	Court	116		2014	India	Marathi, Hindi, Gujarati, English	English	The dead body of a sewer cleaner is found in a Mumbai manhole. An ageing Dalit activist and mass singer is charged with abetting suicide based on the fiery content of one of his song lyrics, which allegedly may have incited the worker to take his own life. The ensuing trial is drawn out through procedural delays and excuses, and meanders through the absurdities of coached witnesses, arcane colonial legal practices and institutional incompetencies. This Kafkaesque chaos of a low-level court acts as a backdrop to explore the complex personal lives of judge, prosecution and defense alike. The director moves between tragedy and comedy, working with a cast of professional and un-trained actors alike, to bring his dark yet humanist portrait of the Indian justice system to life.

2022	Kitte Mil Ve Mahi (Where the Twain shall meet)	72		2005	India	Punjabi	English	'This film, first of Ajay Bharadwaj''s trilogy on Punjab, contends the dominant perceptions of the economic and spiritual heritage of Punjab. It does so through a people’s narrative on the preservation and regeneration of its ‘little’ traditions, which often appear seamlessly cultural and political. The film invites the audience to travel to the heart of Punjab. To enter a world of Sufi shrines worshipped and looked after by Dalits. To listen to B.S. Balli Qawwal Paslewale, the first generation Dalit Qawwals born out of this tradition. To join a fascinating dialogue with Lal Singh Dil—a radical poet, a Dalit, converted to Islam. To meet the last living legend of the Gadar movement, Baba Bhagat Singh Bilga, who contests the subversion of a common past, while affirming a new consciousness among Dalits, within and beyond Punjab. The interplay between the constituents of this mosaic brings to light the triple marginalisation of Dalits—amidst the agricultural boom that is the modern Punjab, in the contesting ground of its ‘major’ religions, and in the intellectual construction of their ‘syncretism’.'

2019	Strike	88		1925	USSR	Silent	English	A group of oppressed factory workers go on strike in pre-revolutionary Russia.		Sergei Eisenstein	'The son of an affluent architect, Eisenstein attended the Institute of Civil Engineering in Petrograd as a young man. With the fall of the tsar in 1917, he worked as an engineer for the Red Army. In the following years, Eisenstein joined up with the Moscow Proletkult Theater as a set designer and then director. The Proletkult''s director, Vsevolod Meyerhold, became a big influence on Eisenstein, introducing him to the concept of biomechanics, or conditioned spontaneity. Eisenstein furthered Meyerhold''s theory with his own \"montage of attractions\"--a sequence of pictures whose total emotion effect is greater than the sum of its parts. He later theorized that this style of editing worked in a similar fashion to Marx''s dialectic. Though Eisenstein wanted to make films for the common man, his intense use of symbolism and metaphor in what he called \"intellectual montage\" sometimes lost his audience. Though he made only seven films in his career, he and his theoretical writings demonstrated how film could move beyond its nineteenth-century predecessor--Victorian theatre-- to create abstract concepts with concrete images.'
